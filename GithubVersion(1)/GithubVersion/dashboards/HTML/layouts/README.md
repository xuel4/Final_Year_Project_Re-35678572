Dashboard Layouts
=================

lick the .html file in "hero-sidebar" and "split-rows" these two folders to open it on web browser to view the dashboard design.

**Note:** we've used [holder.js](https://github.com/imsky/holder) for labeled cell placeholders, which can be safely removed as you make these layouts your own.
